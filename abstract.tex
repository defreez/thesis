ABSTRACT OF THESIS \\[1.0in]
ANDROID PRIVACY THROUGH ENCRYPTION \\[0.25in]
By Daniel DeFreez \\[1.25in]
\end{center}

\noindent
As mobile computing becomes increasingly prevalent, so to does it become increasingly important to protect the privacy of data on
mobile devices. There is an incredible amount of personal data stored on a ``smart'' phone running an operating system such as
Android. This study explores the nascent field of Android forensics in relation to the need for privacy. It provides an overview of
Android forensic techniques, along with the privacy-preserving countermeasures that have been developed. It then demonstrates a
novel method of securing data against forensic inspection, with an eye toward how privacy might be preserved in the face of live
memory analysis.
