ABSTRACT OF THESIS \\[1.0in]
ANDROID PRIVACY THROUGH ENCRYPTION \\[0.25in]
By Daniel DeFreez \\[1.25in]
\end{center}

\noindent
This study explores the field of Android forensics in relation to the need for privacy. As the field of mobile forensics becomes
increasingly sophisticated, it is clear that bypassing common privacy measures, such as disk encryption, will become routine.  A new
keying mode for eCryptfs is proposed that could significantly mitigate memory attacks against encrypted file systems. It is shown
how a modified eCryptfs implementation could be used on an Android device.
