As mobile computing becomes increasingly prevalent, so to does mobile forensics become increasingly important.
There is an incredible amount of evidentiary data available on a "smart" phone running an operating system such as Android.
So far, the nascent field of mobile forensics has focused on acquiring and analyzing that data.
Efforts to secure Android against forensic inspection have been either poorly implemented, or limited to full disk encryption.
This project studies the nature of forensics on the Android platform and shows how an anti-forensic build of Android can thwart accepted forensic techniques.
