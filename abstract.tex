ABSTRACT OF THESIS \\[1.0in]
ANDROID PRIVACY THROUGH ENCRYPTION \\[0.25in]
By Daniel DeFreez \\[1.25in]
\end{center}

\noindent
This thesis explores the field of Android forensics in relation to the need for privacy. As the field of mobile forensics becomes
increasingly sophisticated, it is clear that bypassing common privacy measures, such as disk encryption, will become routine.  A new
keying method for eCryptfs is proposed that could significantly mitigate memory attacks against encrypted file systems. It is shown
how eCryptfs could be modified to implement this keying method on an Android device.
